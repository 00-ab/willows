DANCE
2015
A. B.

DANCE is a two-player game
depicting tense interaction
via a language of actions and elements.
DANCE can represent attitudes and emotions,
competative and collaborative situations,
and is conflict-ambiguous,
meaning that a single set of rules
can represent a wide variety of stories,
including fights, romances, and conversations.

If you want to get started immediately, run PLAY.py.
You will need Python 2.7.

If you're using a shell,
you can simply run: 
	python PLAY.py

If you do this, however,
you won't have any idea what's going on.
DANCE uses non-traditional moves and stats,
and cannot be understood by intuition.
You will need to read manual.txt,
and you should probably have it open
while you play your first few games.

future.txt contains information
about the changes I plan to make.
The biggest change will be the story mode,
which is to say the single-player game.
But this is still far-off,
since it will require an AI module
and a lot of writing.

modders.txt contains information
about how you can change DANCE,
which is offered without license or copyright.
I hope I have made it
relatively easy to customize.
When the game is story-mode-ready,
I hope it will be extremely easy
for others to make their own story modules.

That's all, please enjoy.
