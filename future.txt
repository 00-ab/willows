Dance is constantly a work in progress.
I hope people will add to it or fork it.
For example, it'd be great to have a version
with a real artist's graphics.
(No disrespect to Lat2-Terminus16.)

TO ADD:

- give some advantage to will... maybe player with less will in frict gets -1
  balance? eh...
- Lots more playtesting
- choose your own stats mode
- Mode select / title screen ( mv play.py dg_2p.py, vim DANCE.py 
	(choose from among all files starting with ./dg_*.py ))
- init file / options screen
- Timed mode
- randomized stats mode
- AI:
	- Combat mode
	- Romance mode
- story mode:
	- save files
	- chapter reader
	ie character = {
		'position' : 'lab',
		'earth' : 57,
		'rosaline-trust' : 0,
		}
	or class soul():
	or something like that
	so def chapter reader():
		for loc in locations:
			if loc.key == player['position']
				loc()
	(except with syntax that works)
- Maybe consider walls=on to be the default,
	then work out a way to say
		if d-from-center < max-d-from-center:
			retreat = 0
	(actually, that's a pretty good way to say it)

BUGS:
- advance+retreat from zero
- just check advance+retreat intensively
